Cliptakes allows your hiring managers to accept video interviews from candidates without any input. Hiring managers can easily watch a video introduction for a candidate and make a snappy assessment, saving them time.

Recorded video interviews allow your team to identify the strongest and best-suited applicants for their active vacancies, without wasting unnecessary time conducting in person interviews. 

In addition, video interviews offer a unique way to set candidates apart from the competition. If a client is impressed with a candidate from watching their video, chances are they will get selected to interview first.

Once a candidate completes their interview, you will be emailed a link to watch their video. You are also able to easily embed the video into a WordPress page should you wish to showcase the video on your own website. 

Videos can be emailed directly to the requesting consultant if required.

=	Do I need to edit videos?	=
No. You do not need to edit any of your received videos. Video answers are combined with your set questions to create a ready to watch video interview.
